# Survival-Chicken
A 3D gravity-controlled labyrinth game.

Player control the avatar to escape levels of labyrinths and keep survive. Player may pick up items for extra bonus scores.

Programmed using JavaScript with modeling, collision detection and physics engine. 
The physics engine is THREE.JS (http://threejs.org/)
Also use some GLSL shading.

Worked with Mingze Li and Yile Sun.

This is a final project for Compuiter Graphics, a course at Brandeis University.

To play the game, donwload the file folder and setup a local host server. Then open the .html file in scr folder.
